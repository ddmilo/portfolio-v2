Technology has always been a constant presence in my life, I guess that's the beauty of growing up during a time when the internet was best represented by dial-up modems and AOL mail notifications.

I had always considered myself a tinkerer, always curious and wanting to figure out how things do the things they do. First it started with building computers, which I still do to this day, and that eventually led me down a rabbit hole about programming, though it would be some time before I ultimately walked that path. 

Fast forward to today and I've graduated from a coding bootcamp, got my first job as a developer for a consulting firm, and started my journey as a freelancer.

I bring the same curiosity that I have had for things that catch my eye to my work as a developer. Always looking from different perspectives, trying to figure out how to achieve goals efficiently and creatively.
